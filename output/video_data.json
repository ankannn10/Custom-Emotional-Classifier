        "2:40 carlsen only critized one game and not the entire match, which gukesh himself acknowledged.\nlater on carlsen said that he was proud of gukesh and gukesh is quite mature for an 18 year old.\nas a fellow indian, please don't set false narratives",
        "Proud Moment for India 🇮🇳\nHearty Congratulations to Gukesh Dommaraju, from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, now to become the Youngest World Chess Champion (FIDE 2024), at the age of just 18, you made our country so proud man 🎉🎉🎉",

        "His parents have a very big role in his victory. They invested so much in gukesh, their time money because they 'believe' in the 'talent' of their product yeah it's full on max support from them and it's fully fully worth it you see. Their son scripted a new record. So many parents have such genius kids. Invest in them, hone them on the right path. They can bring wonders.",

        "So proud of Gukesh ! The champion Guki  🏆🎉",
        "Adding more context to Magnus’s criticism, Carlsen wasn’t disappointed when Gukesh won championship, the line said by Carlsen “its hard to understate how bad Gukesh played” was said in a recap at taketaketake after the game 1 when Gukesh lost. To which Gukesh replied that it was his FIRST wcc game and he was very nervous, just like magnus was. Magnus really liked Gukesh’s reponse and replied later in a video “what an excellent and mature response by Gukesh”\n\nSource: https://youtube.com/shorts/mP7IsPtDxjc?si=Wk9YyhY7ed-gqjwD",
        "Gukesh already semi-legendary\nWinning the Candidates tournament at 17 years old is no joke, especially when it had three 2800+ elo players in it \n\nYoungest World Chess Champion ever and probably the best active chess player on earth right now.",
        "Correction needed at 0:32. Ding Liren became world champion at 32 years of age, not 22."
